## Basic Concepts

### 01 - Your First Program | `Console.WriteLine();`

Print `“C# is cool”`.

### 02 - Welcome Message | `Console.ReadLine();`

Receive a name as user input and print a welcome message using this input. 

### 03 - Packing Madness | Modulus

## Conditionals and Loops

### 06 - Flight Kindles | `if .. else`

write a program that takes age as input and print `“Take your kindle”` only if the age is under or equal 19.

### 07 - Difficulty Levels | `switch .. case`

Print the difficulty level based on a number as input, (1 - Easy, 2 - Medium, 3 - Hard) and if the input is an invalid number print `“Invalid option”`.

### 08 - Disney here we come | `while` loop

Write a program that counts from 3 to 0, each number should be printed in a new line. 

### 09 - Up we go | `for` loop

Print how many km a bird will travel each hour over 5 hours of flight if the speed is 80km per hour. 

### 10 - Going once, going twice, Sold | `break;`

Write a program that takes a maximum value and keeps requesting input until the maximum value is exceeded. Then print `“Sold:”` and the value sold to. 

### 11 - Earning a Scholarship | `&&`

Print `Accepted` if the given attendance is 95% and the given average score is 80. Else print `“Denied”` 

### 12 - Multiple of 3 | Project 2

## Methods

### 13 - Fun with methods | Calling a method

Call the method `myFunc();`

### 14 - Get that Discount | Passing argument and Return values

Call the discount method with a number as input and apply a discount of 20% if the number is greater than 10000. If the amount is less than 10000, print the number. 

### 15 - Geometry | Passing multiple arguments

Call the method `Area();` with the parameters `length` and `height` as user inputs, and print the result `area`. 

### 16 - Set it and Forget it | Optional arguments

Write a program that receives names, ages and a language. Print the corresponding information. If no language is given, print `“English”` as default value. 

### 17 - Getting a Raise | Arguments by `ref`

Write a program that receives as input a `salaryBudget` and `percent` , then print the salary befor the increase and the salary after the increase. 

### 18 - Overloading

Complete the overloaded method `Add()` to receive two `int` numbers and two `double` numbers as arguments. 

### 19 - Recursive summing

Write a program that takes N as input and recursively calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to N. 

### 20 - Level Points | Project 3

Passing the first level of a videogame the player gets 1 point, passing the second level the player gets 2, passing the third the player gets 3, and so on. Write a program that receives as input the number of levels completed and recursively calculates the total points.
